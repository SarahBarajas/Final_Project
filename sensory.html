            Individuals with autism often experience unique sensory processing challenges,<br> 
            which can significantly impact their daily lives. Sensory sensitivity in autism <br>
            can manifest as either hypersensitivity (over-responsiveness) or hyposensitivity (under-responsiveness)<br>
             to sensory stimuli such as sounds, textures, tastes,
            and lights1. For example, a person with hypersensitivity might <br>
            find everyday noises unbearably loud or certain fabrics extremely uncomfortable,<br>
             leading to anxiety and avoidance behaviors2.<br>
             Conversely, someone with hyposensitivity might seek out intense sensory experiences,<br>
            such as spinning or touching various textures, to fulfill their sensory needs
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 18px;">
            Sensory processing challenges can also affect an individualâ€™s <br>
            ability to participate in social activities and daily routines. <br>
            For example, a child with auditory hypersensitivity might struggle in a noisy classroom,<br>
             leading to difficulties in focusing and learning. Similarly, someone with tactile sensitivities<br>
             might avoid certain activities, such as playing with sand or finger painting, due to the<br>
             discomfort caused by these textures. These sensory differences can also impact personal <br>
             care routines; for instance, brushing teeth or hair might be distressing due to the sensations<br>
             involved. Understanding and accommodating these sensory needs is crucial in creating supportive<br>
             environments that allow individuals with autism to thrive.
