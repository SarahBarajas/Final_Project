        <h2>What is Autism?</h2>
        
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a developmental<br> disorder that affects
             how individuals communicate, interact,<br> and behave. The term “spectrum”
             reflects the wide range of symptoms and <br>severity levels that can occur. People with autism often 
            have difficulties with social communication  and may engage<br> in repetitive behaviors or have highly focused interests.
            These symptoms typically appear in early childhood,<br> although the exact age of onset can vary
        </p>
            
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            The causes of autism are not fully understood, but it is believed to result from a combination<br>
             of genetic and environmental factors. There is no single known cause,
            <br> and it is not caused by parenting or any specific actions by parents. Early diagnosis and
            <br> intervention are crucial as they can significantly improve the quality of life for individuals with autism.
            <br> Interventions often include behavioral therapies, educational support,
            <br> and sometimes medications to manage specific symptoms
        </p>
        <p style="text-align: center;">
            Living with autism can present unique challenges, but it also comes with distinct strengths. 
            <br>Many individuals with autism have exceptional abilities in areas such as mathematics, music, or art. 
            <br>Understanding and acceptance from society are essential to support individuals with autism in reaching 
            <br>their full potential. Each person with autism is unique, and recognizing their individual strengths <br>
            and needs
             is key to providing effective support and fostering an inclusive environment
